# ChatGPT-Orca

These are my sketches of a Javascript based code injection to be run in the browser.

I was playing around with Chat-GPT and tried to make Instances talk to each other and be able to create new instances.

These are just skripts to play around with, I stopped working on it once I found out about Auto-GPT haha


To use the scripts, just copy/pase the content into your browsers devtools console when you are on chat.openai.com .
I used Safari when writing those, but I think it works on all browsers...

Most of the scripts are broken, only one works, not sure which one..
